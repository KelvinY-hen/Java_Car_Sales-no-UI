•	To add, delete, search, and update all cars’ information.

-	The JSFs may utilize PrimeFaces UI components for an intuitive design.
•	The business tier is an application that contains the business logic and processes with connections to the backend database via JDBC using Enterprise Java Beans (EJB).
